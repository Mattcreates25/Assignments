for Eukaryotes 110774 sequences of the protein are distributed over  1598 species 
for archaea  90 sequences over  23 species 
and for bacteria 432 sequences of the protein are distributed over 361 species

from the hidden Markov models(HMM), lysine is high frequency of appearing  in the first position of the AA , glutamic acid at the 6th and 11th and so on... basically the letter height of the HHM  divides the stack height according to the letter frequency it is also very evident with the alignment  data. highly conserved regions of the sequences are color coded. see below
