# python assignment

Using strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries concepts, find the reverse complement of AAAAATCCCGAGGCGGCTATATAGGGCTCCGGAGGCGTAATATAAAA

```py
#create a string of the sequence
DNA_sequence = 'AAAAATCCCGAGGCGGCTATATAGGGCTCCGGAGGCGTAATATAAAA'
#make an empty variable of the reverse complement
reverse_comp = ""
#create a dictionary of base complements to reverse
rev_dict={"A": "T", "T": "A", "G": "C", "C": "G"}
#reverse the sequence using list comprehension
rev_seq= DNA_sequence[::-1]
#get a list of the nucleotides reverse complements
rev_comp=[rev_dict.get(character) for character in rev_seq]
#create a one string from the list rev_comp
rev_str= "".join(rev_comp)


#print out the sequence
print("DNA_seq=", DNA_sequence)
print("reverse_complement", rev_str)
```

__output__

```
DNA_seq= AAAAATCCCGAGGCGGCTATATAGGGCTCCGGAGGCGTAATATAAAA
reverse_complement TTTTATATTACGCCTCCGGAGCCCTATATAGCCGCCTCGGGATTTTT
```
